# Developing-an-IoT-dashboard-for-real-time-energy-monitoring-and-automation-using-LoRa-communication
This project automates energy monitoring with ESP32, LoRa, sensors, and GSM for alerts. Slave nodes collect data, the master node processes it, and Thinkspeak ensures real-time cloud visualization. SPI and UART protocols enable reliable communication for efficient energy management.
